# EmberQuickFileSwitch Jetbrains Plugin

Plugin for switching amongst Ember files.

Explicitly whitelisted extensions are:
- js
- html, hbs
- css, scss --> PR welcome

## Key bindings:
If the default shortcut is `Alt + s`.
If this does not fit your needs, just change it in the keymap settings `Ember QuickFileSwitch`.

## Work in progress!
- for now, only the default folder structure is supported:
    ````
    app/
    - compnonents
    - templates
    - etc...

    ````
 - for some reason, background coloring of files doesn't work in the popup
 - popup placement could be improved
